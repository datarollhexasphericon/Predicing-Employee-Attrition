# Understanding Employee Attrition

## Project Motivation and Description

Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations, leading to significant costs in terms of hiring, training, and lost productivity. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee turnover can help businesses develop strategies to retain valuable employees, thus saving resources and maintaining a stable workforce.

This project aims to explore and analyze the factors related to employee attrition using a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, we seek to identify key drivers of employee turnover and provide insights that can aid in decision-making processes to reduce attrition rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data). It contains various features related to employees' demographic, professional, and personal attributes.
